Hey,

My name Farid, I'm 34 years old.

I had been working for 12 years at the Inbal hotel in jerusalem, and now I'm trying to continue the journey which I tried to start long time ago.

I Learned c#, .net core , Java for android development python through my Diploma certificate which I just finished from Ort college in jerusalem.

I have few Ideas for projects that I wish to make through my studying at the bootcamp.
